Answer: 6

## Task 4 Fingerprinting Malware

4.0 In the samples located at Desktop mal directory in the attached VM, which of the samples has the same imphash as file 3?

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2023-02-15-THM-Basic-Static-Analysis-1.png){:width="100%"}

Using ssdeep tool to generate fuzzy hashes for binary 3 and compare it to all binary under mal directory. We can see we have a match to binary 1. 

Answer: 1

4.1 Using the ssdeep utility, what is the percentage match of the above-mentioned files?

Answer: 93
