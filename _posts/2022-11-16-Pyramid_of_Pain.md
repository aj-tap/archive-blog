## Hash Values (Trivial) 
##### 1. Provide the ransomware name for the hash '63625702e63e333f235b5025078cea1545f29b1ad42b1e46031911321779b6be' using open-source lookup tools?

Several online tools can be used to determine which malware family this malicious sample belongs to. We can use Malshare, a public malware repository, to perform hash lookups to determine which malware family this binary belongs to.

##### Answer: craftingalegacy.com

##### 3.1 What term refers to an address used to access websites?
A name is easier to remember than a long string of numbers. An IP address is a lengthy string of numbers. As a result, a domain name is formed to give a simple way for us to communicate with internet-connected devices without having to remember complex numbers.
https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt

##### Answer: domain name


##### 3.2 What type of attack uses Unicode characters in the domain name to imitate the a known domain?
DNS is limited to ASCII characters. This is where punycode comes in. It converts words that cannot be written in ASCII. For instance greek word characters. RFC 3492 described a way to apply this encoding to DNS labels using the a format.
The issue is that an attacker can easily launch a domain name that replaces some ASCII characters with Unicode characters. This is an IDN homograph attack, also referred to as a **Punycode attack.**

## Host Artifacts (Annoying)

##### 4.0 What is the suspicious IP the victim machine tried to connect to in the screenshot above?
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Writeups/writeups-pop-ip.png){:width="100%"}
Based on logs, It is a Powershell script execution that connects to 35.214.215.3 by opening a socket on 1047.  192.168.75.22 is a RFC1918 address which more likely the host, and the c2 server's address is 35.214.215.33.
##### Answer: 35.214.215.33

##### 4.1 Use the tools introduced in task 2 and provide the name of the malware associated with the IP address?
Using Alien OTX, we can find associated files with the IP address

<div id='id-Tools'/>


##  Tools (Challenging)
##### 6.0 Provide the method used to determine similarity between the files? 
By making minor changes to their malware samples, adversaries can easily evade signature-based detection engines. Fuzzy hashing will use an algorithm such as SSDEEP to hash files into parts and then compare the similarity of those parts. It computes the similarity of two or more files. 

##### Answer: Fuzzy hashing

##### 6.1 Provide the alternative name for fuzzy hashes without the abbreviation?
##### Answer: context triggered piecewise hashes
