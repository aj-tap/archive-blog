An Exchange server was compromised with ransomware. Use Splunk to investigate how the attackers compromised the server.


## Task 1 SITREP

1.0 Start the attached virtual machine.

Username: bellybear

Password: password!!!

Splunk URL: http://MACHINE_IP:8000

Answer: No answer needed

## Task 2 Exchange Server Compromised 

2.0 Can you identify the location of the ransomware?

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2023-02-16-THM-Conti-23.png){:width="100%"}

We can start to find the location of ransomware by using sysmon event ID 11.

``index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=11``

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2023-02-16-THM-Conti-24.png){:width="100%"}

Using Sysmon event code 11 to filter the logs. We can se that there is a unusual file named cmd.exe on Document folder of the Administrator.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2023-02-16-THM-Conti-25.png){:width="100%"}

The file also drops a readme.txt which is the ransomware note.

Answer: ``c:\\Users\\Administrator\\Documents\\cmd.exe``

2.1 What is the Sysmon event ID for the related file creation event?

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon

Answer: 11

2.2 Can you find the MD5 hash of the ransomware?

``index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" Image="c:\\Users\\Administrator\\Documents\\cmd.exe" md5``

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2023-02-16-THM-Conti.png){:width="100%"}

Answer: 290C7DFB01E50CEA9E19DA81A781AF2C

2.3 What file was saved to multiple folder locations?

``index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=11 TargetFilename="*readme.txt"``

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2023-02-16-THM-Conti-11.png){:width="100%"}

The ransomware note, readme.txt, which is dropped by cmd.exe in the Admin Document directory, saves in multiple folder locations.

Answer: readme.txt

2.5 What was the command the attacker used to add a new user to the compromised system?

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2023-02-16-THM-Conti-12.png){:width="100%"}

We can see that in MITRE Attack framework. Conti uses Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell. **net user command**  is the one that Windows users can use to manage user accounts, read on to know how to add users from CMD.

``index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" CommandLine="*net*"| rare limit=20 CommandLine``

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2023-02-16-THM-Conti-14.png){:width="100%"}

Answer: ``net user /add securityninja hardToHack123$``

2.6 The attacker migrated the process for better persistence. What is the migrated process image (executable), and what is the original process image (executable) when the attacker got on the system?

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2023-02-16-THM-Conti-15.png){:width="100%"}

CreateRemotethread is  a Windows API function that allows a process to create a thread in a different process. This is commonly abused by malware to evade and hide. 

``index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode=8``

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2023-02-16-THM-Conti-18.png){:width="100%"}

Powershell was used to migrate to unsecapp.exe, and hashes were retrieved using LSASS, which is commonly used by attackers to dump password hashes.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2023-02-16-THM-Conti-16.png){:width="100%"}


Answer: ``C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe,C:\Windows\System32\wbem\unsecapp.exe``


2.7 The attacker also retrieved the system hashes. What is the process image used for getting the system hashes?

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2023-02-16-THM-Conti-17.png){:width="100%"}

Answer: ``C:\Windows\System32\lsass.exe``

2.8 What is the web shell the exploit deployed to the system?

common webshell collection are PHP ASP ASPX PY JSP JSPX PER.

Answer: i3gfPctK1c2x.aspx

2.9 What is the command line that executed this web shell?

``index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" i3gfPctK1c2x.aspx``

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2023-02-16-THM-Conti-20.png){:width="100%"}


Answer: ``attrib.exe  -r \\\\win-aoqkg2as2q7.bellybear.local\C$\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\i3gfPctK1c2x.aspx``
