My name is Aj. I'm currently a Computer Science student, quenching a never-ending thirst for knowledge. I've been tinkering with old computers and video games since I was a kid. I'm curious about how they work. These sparked my interest in learning security, and I'm committing to learning and making the cyber world a safer place.

This website will include resources, security blogs, and articles. Feel free to contact me ðŸ˜„.
